# LinkToBooks Price Fetchers

This repository contains the code that is used to fetch the price and other
information for a particular book from a particular vendor.

How the price is fetched varies from an API call to scraping the vendor's
website.

The extracted information is returned in a standard form that can then be
cleaned up as needed.
